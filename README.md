#Drone Control Code
Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElectronicsClub/Drone.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ElectronicsClub/Drone)
##Uses arduino for both the controller and aerial drone
This code (unfinished at the moment) powers both the controller and the actual drone.
It is being written to run our school project, which is to build a drone.

You will need [my include file copier](https://github.com/PML369/Arduino_include_copier) to make this work properly.
